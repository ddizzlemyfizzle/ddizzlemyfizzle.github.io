      <p class="Influence-Text">AlphaGo is an AI developped by Google that beat a world class player of the game Go in 2017, a feat considered
        to be 10 years ahead of it's time. AlphaGo's 4-1 victory over champion Lee Sedol shook the whole world, and was an astounding display of creative problem solving
        and analitycal "thinking" by a machine.

      <p class="Influence-Text">The Dark Souls series of video games has proven to me that games can be an art form. The story, music,
        landscape and unforgiving gameplay all come together to make a tragically beautiful experience.It is balanced in such a way that the game 
        is not unfairly difficult, but rather very punishing of your mistakes, which I beleive to be the series' crowning acheivement.

     <p class="Influence-Text">Boston Dynamics is a company that develops robots. The machine's progress can be observed through their youtube channel,
      and it's truly a sight to see. It has been incredible to see these robots go from clumsy slow to being able to do backflips and sommersaults better than most humans
      over these past few years.

     <p class="Influence-Text">Homestuck was a webcomic that ran from 2009 all the way to 2016. It is notable because it managed to do a lot
       with very little: most of it was drawn using adobe photoshop. But Homestuck wasn't just a comic: every other page was in fact a short gif,
       there were incredible animations complete with music and sound, made using adobe flash of all things. And it was almost entirely made by one man named Andrew Hussie.
